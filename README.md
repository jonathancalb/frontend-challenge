![Figma Design Preview](./design.png)

## Overview
This repository contains a take-home coding challenge focused on frontend development. The task is to build an interactive chat interface based on a provided Figma design. The challenge is designed to assess your ability to deliver a polished, responsive, and accessible UI with engaging micro-interactions.

## Challenge Summary
- **Goal:** Implement a chat interface from the provided Figma design, with streaming message appearance and a typing indicator.
- **Tech Stack:** React (any framework), TypeScript preferred. Styling approach is up to you (CSS Modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.).
- **Time Limit:** Please spend no more than 2–3 hours. It’s okay to leave TODOs.

## Core Requirements
1. **High-fidelity design:** Match the Figma design closely (spacing, typography, states).
2. **Visual distinction:** Clearly show when the user or AI assistant is speaking.
3. **Mood/tone indicators:** Creatively interpret and display conversation mood/tone changes.
4. **Responsive design:** Works well on desktop and mobile.
5. **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, visible focus states.
6. **Streaming messages:** Assistant messages should appear character-by-character or chunk-by-chunk.
7. **Typing indicator:** Animated dots or waveform pulse while streaming.
8. **Message list behavior:** Auto-scroll while streaming.
9. **Error state:** Show a user-friendly error if sending fails.

## Nice-to-Have (Optional)
- Message retry/cancel.
- Light/dark theme toggle.

## Deliverables
- A working prototype (hosted or runnable locally).
- This README, documenting:
	- What you accomplished
	- Any assumptions made
	- Trade-offs and how you would continue the task with more time (plus a time estimate)
